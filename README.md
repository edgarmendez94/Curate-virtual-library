## Description
Introducing, curate. A revolutionizing way to view and curate image galleries. Curate was inspired by the ever-changing, digital world we live in today and allows users to view galleries of images in a digital museum. Curate also allows users to upload their own image that gets put in the musuem, giving curate users independence and creativity. This application is a full-stack one and connects the front-end and the back end through React.js. Other technologies used include Mongo.db, Express.js, Node.js, Axios, Bootstrap, Apollo, and Graphql.
